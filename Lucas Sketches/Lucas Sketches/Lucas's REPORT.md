<h1>Technical notes</h1>

<p1>When the programming 2 course started I was very worried since I felt that I was lacking a lot when it came to the
basics of programming. When we got started I quickly found out that this was true, so a lot of the time in the
beginning of the course was spent relearning a lot of the things we went through in programming 1.

I have had trouble grasping the programming syntax throughout both of these courses. For example, when to use functions instead of if /else statements and what the difference between them really is. A second problem was that I had a lot of problems with remembering how the code in Javascript was supposed to be written, I had to look up how to write a function
or how to write 'eventListeners' every single time, which made coding a lot more time consuming than it could have been.

However, the more I worked with Javascript during the initial part of the course, I became more familiar with the syntax and
eventually working with it didn't feel like such a hurdle anymore. In the final project for the course we used the Arduino a lot which we had gotten familiar with earlier on in the Physical Prototyping course.
