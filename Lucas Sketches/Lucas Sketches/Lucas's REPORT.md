<h1>Technical notes</h1>

<p1>When the programming 2 course started I felt worried since I suspected that I was lacking a lot when it came to the
basics of programming. When we got started I quickly found out that this was true, so a lot of the time in the
beginning of the course was spent relearning a lot of the things we went through in programming 1.

I have had trouble grasping the programming syntax throughout both of these courses. Firstly, when to use functions instead of if /else statements and what the difference between them really is. Secondly, I had a lot of troubles with remembering how the code in Javascript is supposed to be written, I had to look up how to write a function
or how to write 'eventListeners' every single time, which made coding a lot more time consuming than it could have been.

However, the more I worked with Javascript during the initial part of the course, I became more familiar with the syntax and
eventually, working with it, didn't feel like such a hurdle anymore. In the final project for the course we used the Arduino a lot which we had gotten familiar with earlier on in the Physical Prototyping course.

Because we used our Arduino kits we managed to produce quite high fidelity prototypes early on in the project which proved to be problematic for us since we put way to much focus on the functionality of one prototype rather than developing varieties and exploring different forms and materials.
