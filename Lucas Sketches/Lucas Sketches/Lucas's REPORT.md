<h1>Technical notes</h1>

<p1>When the programming 2 course started I felt worried since I suspected that I was lacking a lot when it came to the
basics of programming. When we got started I quickly found out that this was true, so a lot of the time in the
beginning of the course was spent relearning a lot of the things we went through in programming 1.

I have had trouble grasping the programming syntax throughout both of these courses. Firstly, when to use functions instead of if /else statements and what the difference between them really is. Secondly, I had a lot of troubles with remembering how the code in Javascript is supposed to be written, I had to look up how to write a function
or how to write 'eventListeners' every single time, which made coding a lot more time consuming than it could have been.

However, the more I worked with Javascript during the initial part of the course, I became more familiar with the syntax and
eventually, working with it, didn't feel like such a hurdle anymore. In the final project for the course we used the Arduino a lot which we had gotten familiar with earlier on in the Physical Prototyping course.

Because we used our Arduino kits we managed to produce quite high-fidelity prototypes early on in the project which proved to be problematic for us since we put way too much focus on the functionality of one prototype rather than developing varieties and exploring different forms and materials. 

Programming can be a great tool for prototyping interactivity, even a little cardboard box can turn into a high-fidelity prototype after adding the Arduino board along with simple components. In our case we worked a lot with different sensors in order to test how one could interact with an object merely by presence and/or using gestures. In my case I worked with the 'ultrasonic range finder hc-sr04'. An example of how I used coding in my prototype was when I established the cross-device connection between my Arduino board and a live server using webSockets. When the range finder was approached, a music player was 'activated' in the browser and after the user was done choosing a song and walked away the music player would fade away while the music kept playing. This goes to show how much demonstrational value you can add to your prototype by using programming.

Programming however, is not completely without its problems when it comes to prototyping. Like earlier mentioned I have become gradually more comfortable with using code but it is still a very time-consuming activity for me since I am still learning a lot. There is also the risk of getting stuck in the mindset that programming is the only way to solve everything.
