Having to work with Arduino came at the right time. For me, the final project was about programming to prototype.
Having some knowledge of programming, was enough for me to run an Arduino kit.it felt awesome to run codes from Arduino into  prototypes and these prototypes  come to life. 

 This made my prototype feel more  digital. I felt  that learning to program means learning how to solve problems using codes.
Using the arduino board and sensor an insight i had problems with was solved by reading through some ardruino github files .

Making positive insights in my programming, I made sure I knew what I wanted to achieve. I had to make prototypes and these prototypes are supposed to be presented to users for user testing. 
We worked as a group but we had individual task assigned and that brought out the zeal to know more about programming and arduino. I had to make my prototype work.
Arduino codes being run into the computer are easy to figure out but one has to hold on to it. 

Everybody makes mistakes while programming and finding mistakes in programs consumes a very large part of a programmer’s work-day. Finding a problem in a small and easy piece of code is much simpler than trying to spot it in a large program. This is why one  should try to test each sub task identified during  task-breakdown . Only after you’re confident that each part works as you expect the  you can attempt to plug them together. 
I experienced a hitch when using the Arduino Uno to make a cross over connection from my board to my computer. My prototype was having a buzzer and one LED light. The code and setup was okay but the serial port was having no readings and the local host was blank.
A suggestion from my fellow course mate made me change the Uno to the micro and the bridge was complete.That single debugging was one in a million fpor me because i was begining to get worked up.


I was able to run codes on a prototype as a first-time experience thing to me.  I have never thought it could be possible to have a combination of some pieces of cardboard and a microcontroller kit to control an interactive object. This final project got me impressed with myself.

Programming codes   I believe are supposed to be simple. Complicated logic for achieving a simple thing in programming should be kept to a minimum since the code might be modified by another programmer in the future and that is the case of the Arduino codes. The coding I did on this project was with Arduino. Arduino codes are easy to read and the upload is stress free. The prototype I worked on  involved  the device lightening  up as  a person comes into the range . This range distance defines the media player  to  express its availability. A buzzer was added to it create a small sound to also to  indicate it  availability . 

Conclusively, the overall experience was great and it felt okay to have a prototype come ito existence with the help of programming. I wonder how the world will have been without programming.
